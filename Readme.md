## Advanced Lane Finding for Self-Driving Cars
The goal of this project is to produce a robust pipeline for detecting lane lines from raw images captured by camera. The pipeline should output a visual display of the lane boundaries, numerical estimation of lane curvature, and vehicle position within the lane.
